The Observatory is a character management system for fictional universes, with a
focus on long-running roleplaying worlds. It'll help you keep an eye on the
stars of your favorite 'verse.

With the Observatory, it's possible to manage characters with many different
relationships to each other, characters who are alternate versions of other
characters, characters with many nicknames, any kind of character you need.

Keep track of the things that tie your characters together with Tags, and divide
them into Categories like Race, Class, Alignment and so on. Or just use them to
group characters that happen to go together.

Upload your Sessions, whether they be forum roleplays, chat logs, or even
episode transcripts or stories. Or, use the powerful built-in chatroom to play
out your stories in real-time, tied tightly to the data stored elsewhere.
